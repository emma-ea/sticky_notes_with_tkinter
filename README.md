# Sticky notes app with tkinter

Just another sticky note app written with the tkinter ui toolkit

Currently adding new features anytime possible.

## How it works

1. Script builds a window with an input field
2. On keypress saves every keystroke to a file
3. Done. Rerun script, loads notes from the file
